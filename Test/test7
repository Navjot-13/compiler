## Nested loops

begin {
    int weeks;
    weeks = 0;
    int days;
    days = 0;

    ## Outer loop prints weeks
    ifloop (weeks < 3) {
        string s;
        s = "Week: ";
        print(s);
        print(weeks);
        ifloop(days < 7) {
            s = "Day: ";
            print(s);
            print(days);
            days = days + 1;
        }
        weeks = weeks + 1;
